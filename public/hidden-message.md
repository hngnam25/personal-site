# Xin chào tìn iu

Happy birthday baby!! 

I'm so grateful that you have stumbled into my life and, in doing so, made me the happiest man ever. I genuinely wake up every day and I just feel lucky that you chose me and you continue to decide to choose me every day. Thank you baby for making my heart so full. 

Tui nói thậc với bạn luôn là I have a hard time believing that I have bagged a baddie that doesn't only balance swag but also have so much care for the people around you luôn á. Từ Jinwon, Agnes, Elena, cho đến Dung và anh, cũng như các bạn khác, I feel like everyone here feels loved and seen just having you in our life. I genuine love love the way you look out for your friends and I just feel lucky every day that I even get to be one of your friends too. 

Hơn nữa là as a girlfriend thì tui thực sự là cảm thấy được rằng bạn iu tui cực kỳ nhiều. I don't say this very often but I really really appreciate every single time you fly out to see me. I feel so lucky that I have a girlfriend who is so ready to travel hundreds of miles to see me every month. To be loved by you is genuinely the highest honor I could ever ask for.

Lớn hơn một tuổi rồi, anh mong tuổi này anh vẫn luôn được yêu Khánh và chúc Khánh luôn luôn xinh gái, ít bướng và always keep that sparkles in your eyes!!. I love you so so much and I can't wait to see what you will do this year <3

Thank you for being my home^^,
Nam đẹp zai
